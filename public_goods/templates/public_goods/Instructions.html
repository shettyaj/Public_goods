        In this study, you will be in a randomly formed group
        of {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants. Each participant in
        the group is given {{ Constants.endowment }}. The group
        has the opportunity to undertake a joint project. Each participant in
        the group decides how much she or he is going to contribute to
        the project. Contribution could be any integer from 0
        to {{ Constants.endowment }}. After every round the participant with 
        the maximum contribution is given a chance to punish any of the 
        participants. In the next round the contribution that the punished
        becomes {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }} times. The chance to punish the
        participants is given in all the {{ Constants.num_rounds }} rounds.

        The earnings from the project are calculated as follows: The
        contributions of all {{ Constants.players_per_group }} participants are
        added up, the total contribution
        is multiplied by a factor of {{ Constants.efficiency_factor }}, and the
        resulting amount is the total earnings from the project, which is
        evenly split among all {{ Constants.players_per_group }}
        participants. Your payoff equals your earnings from the project, plus
        the amount you did not contribute.
